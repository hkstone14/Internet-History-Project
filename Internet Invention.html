        <h1>Internet Invention</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Internet is the defining technology of our time and historic revolution in communications for the human
            race.
            That is changing the world well the Internet is the next big thing it is on a par with the wheel and fire and
            language and the printing press. The internet enables millions of people with personal computers to communicate
            and
            connect its email. Youâ€™ve got mail its news groups and chat rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the age of the Internet a global network of computer-based communication. At the turn of the 21st
            century
            millions of people around the world are now online every day to exchange messages conduct business meet people
            and
            find information free from the limits of time distance and even tyranny computer communication can also be a
            tool of
            war to manage material and manpower.
        </p>
        <p>
            the at peace or war the worldwide use of the Internet is practically indispensable yet its origins date back
            only to
            the 1950s no invention in history has grown so fast to touch so many lives it's something that we didn't see
            with
            the telephone with the automobile or with the printing press this is an absolutely incredible communications
            tool
            and it gives us instant access to things happening everywhere in scope more email is exchanged on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            in 1969 to link computers to share information was now at the turn of the century the future at present there
            are
            over 11 million domain names registered on the Internet and nearly 70 million web sites WW comm and at are the
            new
            icons of the Information Age with the enormous use of the internet and the web innovation and evolution will
            continue and it will reinvent communications of all kinds I don't think we know yet just how important this is
            many
            of us believe this is in fact the telecommunications infrastructure for the 21st century that it will absorb and
            support all of the other media telephony television radio and then of course conventional computer
            communications
            but in some sense it's still early days remember that this system is no older in 1999 then the telephone system
            was
            in 1900 you know telephones 123 years old the Internet is only 30 years old and it's got a lot of future ahead
            of it
            so don't think for a moment that this little look at the history is gonna capture it all.
