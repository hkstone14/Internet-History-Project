        <P>
            you know us humans we've been pretty busy these past few millennia. this is whenever it was we stopped
            dragging our knuckles on the ground made the great leap forward from chimpanzee to Homo-sapiens. we've made
            a lot of mischief. that's for sure we've also created some pretty cool gear which kind of got me thinking
            thousands of years from now when learning scholars gaze back and try to list the most important
            transformative. world-changing inventions in the history of humanity what's likely to make the cut the
            electric light bulb steam engine the internal combustion engine aeroplane.

            A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The "First Browser War"
            during the late 1990s pitted Microsoft's Internet Explorer against Netscape's Navigator. Browser wars
            continued with the decline of Internet Explorer's market share and the popularity of other browsers
            including Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
        </p>
        <p>
            The World Wide Web is an Internet-based hypertext system invented in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Tim
            Berners-Lee. He wrote the first web browser World Wide Web, later renamed Nexus, and released it for the
            Next step platform in 1991.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mosaic Wars
            Further browsers were released in 1993, including Cello, Arena, Lynx, tkWWW, and Mosaic. The most
            influential of these was Mosaic, a multiplatform browser developed at National Center for Supercomputing
            Applications (NCSA). By October 1994, Mosaic was "well on its way to becoming the world's standard
            interface", according to Gary Wolfe of Wired.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ages of the Internet—before Mosaic, and after. The combination of Tim Berners-Lee's Web
            protocols, which provided connectivity, and Marc Andreesen's browser, which provided a great interface,
            proved explosive. In twenty-four months, the Web has gone from being unknown to absolutely ubiquitous.
        </p>
        <p>
            To resolve legal issues with NCSA, the company was renamed Netscape Communications Corporation and the
            browser Netscape Navigator. The Netscape browser improved on Mosaic's usability and reliability and was able
            to display pages as they loaded. By 1995, helped by the fact that it was free for non-commercial use, the
            browser dominated the emerging World Wide Web.
            Other browsers launched during 1994 included IBM Web Explorer, Navi press, SlipKnot, MacWeb, and Browse.
        </p>
        <p>
            First Browser War (1995–2001)
            By mid-1995, the World Wide Web had received a great deal of attention in popular culture and the mass
            media. Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser and Microsoft had licensed Mosaic to create
            Internet Explorer 1.0, which it had released as part of the Microsoft Windows 95 Plus! pack in August.
            Internet Explorer 2.0 was released as a free download three months later. Unlike Netscape Navigator, it was
            available to all Windows users free of charge, this also applying to commercial companies. Other companies
            later followed suit and released their browsers free of charge. Both Netscape Navigator and competitor
            products like InternetWorks, Quarterdeck Browser, InterAp, and WinTapestry were bundled with other
            applications to full Internet suites.
            In October 1997, Internet Explorer 4.0 was released. The release party in San Francisco featured a
            ten-foot-tall letter "e" logo. Netscape employees showing up to work the following morning found the logo on
            their front lawn, with a sign attached that read "From the IE team ...We Love You." The Netscape employees
            promptly knocked it over and set a giant figure of their Mozilla dinosaur mascot atop it, holding a sign
            reading "Netscape 72, Microsoft 18" representing the market distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Netscape began with about 80% market share and a good deal of public goodwill, as a relatively small
            company deriving the great bulk of its income from what was essentially a single product (Navigator and its
            derivatives), it was financially vulnerable. it was told by Jim Barksdale, President and CEO of Netscape
            Communications: “Very few times in warfare have smaller forces overtaken bigger forces...”
            Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows, which had an over 90% share of the desktop
            operating system market, allowing the company to obtain market share more easily than Netscape, as customers
            already had Internet Explorer installed as the default browser.
